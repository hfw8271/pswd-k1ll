What is the goal of this tool? What purpose does it bring to the competitions?
  check the read me ;)

Did other tools influence your tool? If so, what are they? If not, what was your inspiration for the tool?
  I wanted to make a passwd shim, its similar to how retriever works, but retriever is definitely 100x better

What is the feasibility of another team member quickly learning to use or contribute to your tool? What makes it easy or difficult to learn?
  once i write it into our ansible deploy it will be very easy, and if I can make a nice UI itll be really easy for the team to use
